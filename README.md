# stoolbox
Stoolbox is a collection of shell scripts. In contrast to sharing a massive single rc file, I prefer segregating shell configurations into multiple standalone files, making them readily available for others to reference and selectively incorporate preferred features into their own setup.

- **fuzzy_pwd_file_select.ps1**: efficiently select files in the current working directory using fuzzy matching. 
- **gcopy.ps1**: copy files to clipboard within the command-line.
- **gpaste.ps1**: paste files from clipboard in the command-lien.
- **lsd.ps1**: displays file timestamps (creation, modification, access times) for specified files.
- **pau.ps1 pam.ps1**: add current path to the PATH environment variable.
- **sound_volume.ps1**: adjust system sound volume using 'j' and 'k' keys.
- **watch.ps1**: execute commands at regular intervals for monitoring purposes. 
- **whereis.ps1**: locate positions of specific commands within the system. 
- **untargz.ps1 untarxz.ps1 untar.ps1**: extract .tar.gz(tar.xz) .tar files to a specified output folder.
